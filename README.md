# Resume Model

## Overview

This project is a simple and elegant resume model created using HTML and CSS. The model includes a single HTML file (`index.html`), a CSS stylesheet (`style.css`), and a `media` folder containing icons and a profile picture to enhance the visual appeal.

## Files and Structure

- **index.html:** This file contains the structure of the resume. It includes sections for personal information, education, work experience, skills, projects and contact details.

- **style.css:** The stylesheet defines the visual presentation of the resume. It includes styling for fonts, colors, layout, and responsiveness.

- **media:** This folder holds various media assets such as icons and a profile picture. These assets are used to enhance the design elements of the resume.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the resume.
3. Customize the content in `index.html` to reflect your personal information, education, work experience, skills, etc.
4. Modify the styles in `style.css` to suit your preferred visual aesthetics.
