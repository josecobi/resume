## Files and Structure

- **index.html:** This file contains the structure of the resume. It includes sections for personal information, education, work experience, skills, projects and contact details.

- **style.css:** The stylesheet defines the visual presentation of the resume. It includes styling for fonts, colors, layout, and responsiveness.
